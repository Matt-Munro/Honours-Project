CLINTON thinks about this a lot
Today is my granddaughter's second birthday
"we need new jobs , good jobs , with rising incomes"
"we have to build an economy that works for everyone , not just those at the top"
most of the new jobs will come from small business
CLINTON wants us to invest in you
CLINTON wants us to invest in your future
"That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee , finally , equal pay for women's work"
We also have to make the economy fairer
CLINTON also wants to see more companies do profit sharing
"If you help create the profits , you should be able to share in them , not just the executives at the top"
CLINTON wants us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work
CLINTON 's heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you 're under
"let 's have paid family leave , earned sick days"
Let 's be sure we have affordable child care and debt free college
Our jobs are fleeing the country
They 're going to Mexico
They 're going to many other countries
They 're devaluing their currency
there 's nobody in our government to fight them
"we 're losing our good jobs , so many of them"
they 're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China
many other countries are doing the same thing
"When you look at what 's happening in Mexico , a friend of mine who builds plants said it 's the eighth wonder of the world"
"They 're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world , some of the most sophisticated , some of the best plants"
So Ford is leaving
"With the United States , as he said , not so much"
"You see that , their small car division leaving"
"Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan , leaving Ohio"
we ca n't allow it to happen anymore
"We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and , with it , firing all of their people"
we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us
"They left , fired 1,400 people"
"Under TRUMP's plan , TRUMP 'll be reducing taxes tremendously , from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies , small and big businesses"
We can not let it happen
That 's going to be a job creator like we have n't seen since Ronald Reagan
Companies will come
They will build
They will expand
We have to renegotiate our trade deals
we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs
"we need to have smart , fair trade deals"
we are 5 percent of the world 's population ; we have to trade with the other 95 percent
the kind of plan that TRUMP has put forth would be trickle down economics all over again
"it would be the most extreme version , the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we 've ever had"
"We just have a different view about what 's best for growing the economy , how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes"
we come at it from somewhat different perspectives
"TRUMP was very fortunate in TRUMP's life , and that 's all to TRUMP's benefit"
"He started his business with $ 14 million , borrowed from his father"
"CLINTON and others , politicians , should have been doing this for years , not right now"
we 've created a movement
the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave
the companies are leaving
the companies are leaving in bigger numbers than ever
there are thousands of these companies
our politicians never tax them coming in
the special interests want those companies to leave
our politicians have special interests
"in many cases, our politicians own the companies"
tax policies created a perfect storm
tax policies took their eyes off of Wall Street
tax policies failed to invest in the middle class
tax policies slashed taxes on the wealthy
the Great Recession was in large part because of tax policies
TRUMP was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis
"back in 2006 TRUMP was hoping it would collapse, because then he can go in and buy some houses and make some money"
housing did collapse
we 're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy
now we have come back from that abyss
the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place
coming back from that abyss has not been easy
we can have enough clean energy to power every home
we can deploy a half a billion more solar panels
we can build a new modern electric grid
that 's a lot of jobs
that 's a lot of new economic activity
that was a disaster to invest in a solar company
they lost plenty of money on investing in a solar company
our energy policies are a disaster
we 're putting a lot of people out of work
our country is losing so much in terms of energy
our country is losing so much in terms of paying off our debt
CLINTON can't do what she is looking to do with $ 20 trillion in debt
we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand
they 're not doing it
all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving
CLINTON is just thinking about these solutions right now
CLINTON has been doing this for 30 years
CLINTON can't bring back jobs
CLINTON has thought about bringing back jobs for not quite that long
Bill Clinton did a pretty good job in the 1990s
CLINTON has thought about bringing back jobs quite a bit
CLINTON thinks a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again
CLINTON thinks a lot about million new jobs
CLINTON thinks a lot about a balanced budget
incomes went up for everybody
"manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s , if we 're actually going to look at the facts"
CLINTON has a very robust set of plans
We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business
"we need to have strong growth , fair growth , sustained growth"
"people have looked at both of our plans , have concluded that CLINTON's would create 10 million jobs and TRUMP's would lose us 3.5 million jobs , and explode the debt which would have a recession"
CLINTON is going to drive business out
CLINTON is going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history
CLINTON is going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history
"CLINTON's regulations are a disaster , and CLINTON is going to increase regulations all over the place"
It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs
TRUMP's tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan
new companies can not form and old companies are going out of business
You have regulations on top of regulations
CLINTON is going to regulate these businesses out of existence
CLINTON wants to increase the regulations and make them even worse
TRUMP 's going to cut taxes big league
CLINTON 's going to raise taxes big league
"CLINTON has taken the home page of CLINTON's website , HillaryClinton.com , and CLINTON has turned it into a fact checker"
CLINTON kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims
What CLINTON has proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy
they have made all the gains in the economy
it 's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country
TRUMP doesn't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much
CLINTON is telling the enemy everything she wants to do
TRUMP is really calling for major jobs
the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs
the wealthy are going to expand their companies
the wealthy are going to do a tremendous job
"if you really look , it 's not a tax"
tax is really not a great thing for the wealthy
they can't bring the money back from the overseas
politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back
the taxes are so onerous
there is the bureaucratic red tape
is so bad
what they 're doing is they 're leaving our country
they're leaving
taxes are too high
some of them have lots of money outside of our country
they're leaving instead of bringing the money back and putting the money to work
they can't work out a deal
"instead of bringing money back , they're leaving our country to get their money"
they can't bring their money back into our country
because of bureaucratic red tape
they ca n't get together
we have a president that ca n't sit them around a table and get them to approve something
Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done
Republicans and Democrats agree that it is $ 2.5 trillion that we can't bring to our country
we have no leadership
that starts with Secretary Clinton
I happen to support that
"CLINTON doesn't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals TRUMP is referring to that would cause the repatriation , bringing back of money that 's stranded overseas"
"when CLINTON looks at what TRUMP has proposed , you have what is called now the Trump loophole"
TRUMP's tax proposal would so advantage TRUMP and the business TRUMP does
Trickle down did not work
"It got us into the mess we were in , in 2008 and 2009"
Slashing taxes on the wealthy has n't worked
"a lot of really smart , wealthy people know that"
"they are saying , hey , we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class"
top down does not work in America
Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy
"Broad based , inclusive growth is what we need in America , not more advantages for people at the very top"
Typical politician
"All talk , no action"
"Sounds good , does n't work"
Never going to happen
we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression
believe TRUMP : We 're in a bubble right now
"the only thing that looks good is the stock market , but if you raise interest rates even a little bit , that 's going to come crashing down"
"We are in a big , fat , ugly bubble"
we better be awfully careful
we have a Fed that 's doing political things
The Fed is doing political
by keeping the interest rates at this level
"believe TRUMP : The day Obama goes off , and OBAMA leaves , and goes out to the golf course for the rest of OBAMA's life to play golf , when they raise interest rates , you 're going to see some very bad things happen"
the Fed is not doing their job
Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest
"the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to , who he owes it to and any business conflicts"
"you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections , where TRUMP filed a 104 page essentially financial statement of sorts , the forms that they have"
"It shows income , in fact , the income , I just looked today , the income is filed at $ 694 million for this past year , $ 694 million"
we have a country that 's doing so badly
that 's being ripped off by every single country in the world
it 's the kind of thinking that our country needs
"we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with , of almost $ 800 billion a year"
"in a way , TRUMP should be complaining"
TRUMP has been under audit almost for 15 years
TRUMP knows a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited
TRUMP gets audited almost every year
TRUMP 's not even complaining
TRUMP does n't mind it
It 's almost become a way of life
We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of
TRUMP gets audited by the IRS
But other people don't
"that 's against , my lawyers"
TRUMP_LAWYERS : Do n't do it
"When the audit 's complete , TRUMP 'll do it"
"Almost every lawyer says , you do n't release your returns until the audit 's complete"
it 's negotiable
TRUMP would go against TRUMP_LAWYERS if CLINTON releases CLINTON's e mails
Let CLINTON release the e mails
"CLINTON should not have deleted 33,000"
TRUMP won't release his tax returns because of X
there may be a couple of reasons why TRUMP won't release his tax returns
"maybe TRUMP doesn't want the American people and all people watching tonight , to know that he 's paid nothing in federal taxes"
the only years that anybody 's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license
they showed he did n't pay any federal income tax
probably TRUMP is not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are
"it must be something really important , even terrible , that he 's trying to hide"
the financial disclosure statements don't give the tax rate
CLINTON has no reason to believe that TRUMP is ever going to release his tax returns
there's something TRUMP is hiding
TRUMP should provide the answers to that questions
TRUMP owes the audience the answers to that questions
TRUMP owes money to X
it was more than a mistake to use private e mail
that was done purposely
that was not a mistake
it 's disgraceful
"CLINTON has her staff taking the Fifth Amendment, so they 're not prosecuted"
CLINTON has the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth Amendment
maybe TRUMP is not as rich as he says he is
we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $ 650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks
CLINTON should go down and take a look at financial disclosure
CLINTON learns a lot from financial disclosure
$ 650 is really not a lot of money
a lot of friends of mine that know my business say that $ 650 is not a lot of money
TRUMP is extremely underleveraged
in the same report they said that the buildings are worth $ 3.9 billion
TRUMP is very underleveraged
TRUMP has a great company
TRUMP has a tremendous income
the reason TRUMP says that is not in a braggadocios way
our airports are like from a third world country
"you land at LaGuardia , you land at Kennedy , you land at LAX , you land at Newark , and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible , you come in from China , you see these incredible airports"
we've become a third world country
we have $ 20 trillion in debt
our country 's a mess
the worst of all things has happened
we haven't even started
we 've spent $ 6 trillion in the Middle East
according to a report that I just saw
we could have rebuilt our country twice if we haven't spent $ 6 trillion in the Middle East
it's politicians like CLINTON that have caused this problem
it 's really a shame that we could have rebuilt our country twice if we haven't spent $ 6 trillion in the Middle East
our country has tremendous problems
we're a debtor nation
"we have a country that needs new roads , new tunnels , new bridges , new airports , new schools , new hospitals"
we don't have the money
the money has been squandered on so many of CLINTON's ideas
TRUMP hasn't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years
"if TRUMP has paid federal income tax, this money would be squandered too"
TRUMP built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys
CLINTON has met a lot of the people who were stiffed by TRUMP and TRUMP's businesses
"CLINTON has met dishwashers , painters , architects , glass installers , marble installers , drapery installers , like her dad was , who TRUMP refused to pay when they finished the work that TRUMP asked them to do"
You questioned his legitimacy
"for five years , TRUMP perpetuated a false claim that the nation 's first black president was not a natural born citizen"
TRUMP got OBAMA to give the birth certificate
"When TRUMP got involved , TRUMP did n't fail"
TRUMP 's satisfied with it
TRUMP wants to get on to things that are very important to TRUMP and that are very important to the country
TRUMP want to get on to defeating ISIS
TRUMP wants to get on to creating jobs
TRUMP wants to get on to having a strong border
"you can go look it up , and you can check it out"
"if you look at CNN this past week , Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened"
"Blumenthal sent McClatchy , highly respected reporter at McClatchy , to Kenya to find out about it"
HOLT will let TRUMP respond
it 's important
HOLT just wants to get the answer here
The birth certificate was produced in 2011
it 's true
Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter
TRUMP says nothing
TRUMP was able to get OBAMA to produce it
OBAMA should have produced it a long time before
"When HOLT talks about healing , TRUMP thinks that TRUMP has developed very , very good relationships over the last little while with the African American community"
you can see that
TRUMP feels that they really wanted TRUMP to come to that conclusion
"TRUMP did a great job and a great service not only for the country , but even for the president , in getting OBAMA to produce OBAMA's birth certificate"
TRUMP tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed
"clearly , as TRUMP just admitted , TRUMP knew TRUMP was going to stand on this debate stage , and HOLT was going to be asking us questions"
it ca n't be dismissed that easily
TRUMP has really started TRUMP's political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen
TRUMP persisted year after year
"some of TRUMP's supporters , people that TRUMP was trying to bring into TRUMP's fold , apparently believed it or wanted to believe it"
TRUMP persisted
There was absolutely no evidence for it
TRUMP has a long record of engaging in racist behavior
"remember , TRUMP started TRUMP's career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because TRUMP would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African Americans , and TRUMP made sure that the people who worked for TRUMP understood that was the policy"
TRUMP actually was sued twice by the Justice Department
the birther lie was a very hurtful one
OBAMA is a man of great dignity
CLINTON could tell how much it bothered OBAMA and annoyed OBAMA that this was being touted and used against OBAMA
It does n't work that way
TRUMP got to watch in preparing for this some of CLINTON's debates against OBAMA
CLINTON treated OBAMA with terrible disrespect
TRUMP watched the way CLINTON talks now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful CLINTON is
CLINTON was after OBAMA
"CLINTON was trying to , CLINTON even sent out or CLINTON's campaign sent out pictures of OBAMA in a certain garb , very famous pictures"
CLINTON cannot deny that
"just last week , CLINTON's campaign manager said it was true"
"TRUMP also notices the very nasty commercials that CLINTON does on TRUMP in so many different ways , which TRUMP does n't do on CLINTON"
Maybe TRUMP 's trying to save the money
that is amazing
TRUMP notices CLINTON brings that up a lot
"TRUMP settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt , but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms , and it 's just one of those things"
comments like that really worry people who understand the threats that we face
TRUMP is unfit to be the commander  in chief
more endorsements are coming next week
it will be over 200 admirals
TRUMP was just endorsed
many of admirals and generals here endorsed TRUMP to lead this country
TRUMP was just endorsed by ICE
"TRUMP was just recently endorsed by 16,500 Border Patrol agents"
"when CLINTON talks about this, TRUMP will take the admirals and the generals any day over the political hacks that TRUMP sees that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge"
we're in a mess
"as far as the cyber attacks, TRUMP agrees to parts of what CLINTON said"
we should be better than anybody else
perhaps we 're not better than anybody else
TRUMP doesn't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC
TRUMP doesn't claim that Rusia is for sure responsible for cyber attacks
it could also be China
it could also be lots of other people
it also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds
"whether that was Russia , whether that was China , whether it was another country , we do n't know"
"he truth is , under President Obama we 've lost control of things that we used to have control over"
CLINTON and TRUMP would agree very much when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet
ISIS are beating USA at their own game
we have to get very tough on cyber and cyber warfare
it is a huge problem
we have so many things that we have to do better
we are not doing the job we should be doing with the security aspect of cyber
CLINTON's plan to defeat ISIS does involve going after ISIS online
"USA need to do much more with their tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize , even direct people in the USA and Europe and elsewhere"
USA is making progress
USA military is assisting in Iraq
USA is hoping that within the year USA will be able to push ISIS out of Iraq
USA is hoping that within the year USA will be able to really squeeze ISIS in Syria
we have to make this the top priority
USA have to be cognizant of the fact that ISIS has had foreign money
USA have to be cognizant of the fact that ISIS has had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them
USA have to be cognizant of the fact that ISIS has had foreign weapons
CLINTON would also do everything possible to take out ISIS' leadership
CLINTON was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when CLINTON was secretary of state
CLINTON was involved in taking out bin Laden
USA need to go after Baghdadi as well
USA need to make going after Baghdadi one of their organizing principles
USA have got to defeat ISIS
USA have got to do everything they can to disrupt ISIS' propaganda efforts online
there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil
the latest incident was the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey
there was the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota
in the last year there were deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando
OBAMA and CLINTON created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq
OBAMA and CLINTON got out what they shouldn't have been in
"once OBAMA and CLINTON got in Iraq, the way they got out was a disaster"
ISIS was formed
CLINTON has been taking out ISIS a long time
CLINTON has been trying to take ISIS out for a long time
"ISIS would n't have even been formed if OBAMA and CLINTON left some troops behind , like 10,000 or maybe something more than that"
"had USA taken the oil, ISIS would not have been able to form either"
the oil was their primary source of income
TRUMP supported the invasion of Iraq
it is absolutely proved over and over again that TRUMP supported the invasion of Iraq
TRUMP actually advocated for the actions OBAMA and CLINTON took in Libya
TRUMP urged that Gadhafi be taken out
the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then Iraqi government that would have protected the US troops
"the larger point , and he says this constantly , is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq , not Barack Obama"
The record does not show that
The record shows that TRUMP's right
"When TRUMP did an interview with Howard Stern , very lightly , first time anyone 's asked TRUMP that , TRUMP said , very lightly , TRUMP do n't know , maybe , who knows"
TRUMP then did an interview with Neil Cavuto
"TRUMP then spoke to Sean Hannity , which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity"
HANNITY : you were totally against the war
they did an article which had TRUMP totally against the war in Iraq
HANNITY was for the war
HANNITY : you used to have fights with me
HANNITY was in favor of the war
TRUMP was against the war
TRUMP used to have fights with HANNITY
"TRUMP understands that side , also , not very much"
we should have never been there
"if you read this article , there 's no doubt"
it 's a terrible and a stupid thing
It 's going to destabilize the Middle East
It 's been a disaster
that 's exactly what it 's done
TRUMP has much better judgment than CLINTON does
There 's no question about that
CLINTON spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising
CLINTON gets Madison Avenue into a room
CLINTON puts names
"TRUMP's strongest asset , maybe by far , is TRUMP's temperament"
TRUMP has a winning temperament
TRUMP also has a much better temperament than CLINTON has
CLINTON does not have a
"The AFL CIO the other day , behind the blue screen , CLINTON was totally out of control"
CLINTON is a person with a temperament that 's got a problem
Iranians had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration
Iranians had built covert facilities
Iranians had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away
USA had sanctioned Iran
CLINTON spent a year and a half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran
it was n't enough to vote for every sanction against Iran
USA did drive Iranians to the negotiating table
that's not good judgment
"that is not the right temperament to be commander in  chief , to be taunted"
American sailors were not taunting Iranian sailors
Iranian sailors were taunting American sailors
the worst part of what we heard TRUMP say has been about nuclear weapons
"TRUMP doesn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan , South Korea , even Saudi Arabia"
"in fact , TRUMP's cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling"
"if there were nuclear war in East Asia, that 's fine"
nuclear war is the number one threat we face in the world
nuclear war becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material
a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes
the line concerning nuclear codes is a good one
the line concerning nuclear codes well describes the problem
"Japan, Germany, South Korea, Saudi Arabia should be paying USA"
USA are providing tremendous service
USA are losing a fortune
"Japan, Germany, South Korea and Saudi Arabia should pay a fair share"
this is n't 40 years ago where we could do what we 're doing
"USA can't defend Japan, a behemoth selling USA cars by the million"
"all TRUMP said was that Japan, Germany, South Korea and Saudi Arabia may have to defend themselves or they have to help USA out"
USA are a country that owes $ 20 trillion
what TRUMP said about nuclear weapons leads to HOLT's next question
we enter our last segment on the subject of securing America
Russia has a much newer capability than USA do
Russia has been expanding
USA have not been updating from the new standpoint
USA are not keeping up with other countries
B 52s are old enough that one's father or grandfather could be flying them
TRUMP would certainly not do first strike
"once the nuclear alternative happens , it 's over"
TRUMP can't take anything off the table
"at the same time , we have to be prepared"
"when you look at some of these countries such as North Korea, USA are doing nothing there"
China should solve that problem for USA
China should go into North Korea
China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea
Iran has power over North Korea
Iran is one of North Korea's biggest trading partners
"when OBAMA and CLINTON made that horrible deal with Iran , they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea"
TRUMP asked KERRY why they didn't do anything with respect to Yemen and all these other places
OBAMA and CLINTON should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places
TRUMP asked KERRY why didn't they add other things into the deal
"that was one of the great giveaways of all time, including $ 400 million in cash"
you say to yourself why did n't they make the right deal
this is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history
the deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems
CLINTON wants to reassure USA allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that USA have mutual defense treaties and USA will honor them
it is essential that America 's word be good
words really matter when you are president
words matter when you run for president
CLINTON knows this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe
CLINTON has talked with a number of leaders across the globe
"CLINTON wants to , on behalf of herself and on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that , USA's word is good"
we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues
"people around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely , trying to get hints about what candidates will do"
"CLINTON intends to be a leader of USA also to stand up to bullies , whether they 're abroad or at home"
we can not let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security
CLINTON intends to be a leader of USA to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity
CLINTON intends to be a leader of USA that people can count on both here at home and around the world
it 's also important that we look at the entire global situation
there 's no doubt that USA have other problems with Iran
CLINTON could have defeated ISIS by never having information on her website
CLINTON should get going in the first place
right now it 's getting tougher and tougher to defeat ISIS
ISIS are in more and more places
ISIS are in more and more states
more and more nations
it's a big problem
USA can not protect countries all over the world
USA can not be the policemen of the world
CLINTON does n't say that
CLINTON 's got no business ability
"sadly , CLINTON does n't have that"
"All of the things that CLINTON 's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years , let 's say , while CLINTON had great power"
"You have to be able to negotiate , that 's right , with Japan , with Saudi Arabia"
You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals
"You have so many different things you have to be able to do , and TRUMP does n't believe that CLINTON has the stamina"
All you have to do is speak to them
CLINTON does n't have the stamina
"CLINTON has experience , but it 's bad experience"
We have made so many bad deals during the last
"it 's bad , bad experience"
"it 's the Iran deal that CLINTON 's so in love with , where we gave them $ 150 billion back"
this country ca n't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience
we 're at the final question now
TRUMP : Miss Housekeeping
she was Latina
everybody would agree that O'Donnel deserves saying tough things to her
Rosie O'Donnell has been very vicious to TRUMP
nobody feels sorry for O'Donnel
"CLINTON voted against the biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA,"
CLINTON holds the same standards as she looks at all of these trade deals
let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy
trade is a part of economy
CLINTON knows how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs
"when CLINTON was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent"
we increased them to China 50 percent
CLINTON has done a lot
CLINTON has been a senator
CLINTON has been a secretary of state
"NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country"
"you go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent"
CLINTON can't win that debate
now CLINTON wants to approve Trans Pacific Partnership
CLINTON was totally in favor of Trans Pacific Partnership
"CLINTON heard what TRUMP was saying, how bad Trans Pacific Partnership is"
Trans Pacific Partnership will be almost as bad as NAFTA
nothing will ever top NAFTA
that is just not accurate
CLINTON was against Trans Pacific Partnership once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out
that is not the facts
"the facts are , CLINTON did say she hoped it would be a good deal"
CLINTON concluded it wasn't
this is President OBAMAa's fault
OBAMA is pushing Trans Pacific Partnership
"we need new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt"
"there are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world"
it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again
CLINTON does have a plan
"CLINTON has written a book about it, it's called ""Stronger Together."""
CLINTON can only say that she's certainly relieved that her late father never did business with TRUMP
TRUMP has taken business bankruptcy six times
"the thousands of people that TRUMP has stiffed over the course of his business deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them"
"TRUMP wouldn't pay what the architect needed to be paid, what he was charging TRUMP to do"
TRUMP calls himself the King of Debt
TRUMP even at one time suggested that he would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States
TRUMP built an unbelievable company
TRUMP bulit some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world
"TRUMP built some of the greatest real etate assets beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places"
"when CLINTON talks about people that didn't get paid, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation"
"on occasion, four times, TRUMP used certain laws that are there"
if CLINTON wants to change the laws she can change the laws
CLINTON has been there a long time
TRUMP takes advantage of the laws of the nation
TRUMP is running a company
"TRUMP's obligation right now is to do well for himself, his family, his employees, and for his companies"
"if TRUMP donesn't get there one way, he's going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another"
we're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House
products for military come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be
we don't have people that know what they're doing
"when we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent"
we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy
we should be able to do that for the USA
the Trump International is way ahead of schedule
the Trump International is way under budget
we need law and order
"If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country"
"when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's , I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long"
"TRUMP just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just , just came in"
"We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very , I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States"
"We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African  Americans, Hispanics are living in hell"
it's so dangerous
"You walk down the street, you get shot"
"In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st"
we have to stop the violence
"In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years"
"almost 4,000 have been killed since OBAMA became president"
"whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York"
It brought the crime rate way down
you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it
We have gangs roaming the street
we have to be very strong
"in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants"
they have guns
they shoot people
we have to be very vigilant
"We have to be , we have to know what we're doing"
We have to protect our inner cities
"African American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated"
stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York
stop and frisk largely singled out black and Hispanic young men
HOLT is wrong in saying that stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men
"It went before a judge, who was a very against police judge"
It was taken away from the judge
the new mayor refused to go forward with the case
the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them
they are bad people that shouldn't have guns
these people are felons
one needs relation
there are no good community relations in Chicago
Chicago's not the only
in Ferguson it is similar as in Chicago
in so many different places it is similar as in Chicago
one needs a better community
one needs more police
one has to have stop and frisk
"when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown"
"when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st"
TRUMP agrees with CLINTON that one needs better relationships
one needs better relationships between the communities and the police
"in some cases, it's not good"
there's some bad things going on
in Dallas the relationships between the communities and the police were really a beautiful thing
then five police officers were killed one night very violently
we need law and order in the inner cities
the people that are most affected by what's happening are African American and Hispanic people
there's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up
we should be proud of the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids
we should be proud of the black businesses that employ so many people
we should be proud of the vibrancy of the black church
it's really unfortunate that TRUMP paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country
stop and frisk was found to be unconstitutional
in part because stop and frisk was ineffective
stop and frisk did not do what it needed to do
"in fact, violent crime is one half of what it was in 1991"
property crime is down 40 percent
we just don't want to see property crime creep back up
we've had 25 years of very good cooperation
there were some unintended consequences
too many young African American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses
there were some problems
"it's just a fact that if someone is young African American man and he does the same thing as a young white man, he is more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated"
we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system
we cannot just say that law and order is sufficient
we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system
"we have to deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little"
we need to have more second chance programs
CLINTON wants to see private prisons ended in the state system
CLINTON is glad that USA are ending private prisons in the federal system
one shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans
here are some positive ways we can work on this
CLINTON believes strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist
right now there are too many military style weapons on the streets
too many military style weapons on the streets is something TRUMP has supported along with the gun lobby
we need comprehensive background checks
in a lot of places the police are outgunned
we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm
we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in the USA
"if someone is too dangerous to fly, someone is too dangerous to buy a gun"
there are things we can do
we ought to do these things in a bipartisan way
"we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way"
"implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police"
too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other
mental health is one of the biggest concerns
now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street
"in CLINTON's first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers"
implicit bias in policing can have literally fatal consequences
"the police want support, they want more training, they want more assistance"
"CLINTON met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago"
the police got a lot of concerns
the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that
TRUMP is very proud of the endorsement of the NRA
"NRA are very, very good people"
NRA is protecting the Second Amendment
"It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good"
five hundred murders is a lot of murders
stop and  frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City
"in New York City, stop and frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop and"
TRUMP is talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them
CLINTON is wrong
"under the current mayor, crime has not continued to drop, including murders"
"CLINTON gives credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs"
it has worked
it is important that we learn about what has been effective
one murder is too many
"we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem"
we should not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want
no one disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe
no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods
the African American community has been let down by our politicians
"politicians talk good around election time, like right now"
"after the election, poiticians said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years"
African American within the inner cities has been so badly treated
African American community has been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians
that's what it is
"TRUMP just left Detroit, TRUMP just left Philadelphia, and TRUMP has been all over the place"
TRUMP has met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities
"they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done"
our institutions are under cyber attack
our secrets are being stole
"cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president"
clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries
there are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money
"increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states"
the most recent and troubling of cyber attacks coming from states has been Russia
there's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country
"PUTIN is playing a really tough, long game here"
"one of the things PUTIN has done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee"
CLINTON was shocked when TRUMP publicly invited PUTIN to hack into Americans
"the Russians have been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do"
we will defend the citizens of this country
"we need to make it very clear , whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else , the United States has much greater capacity"
"we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private sector information or our public sector information"
we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have
we don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare
the Russians need to understand that
"CLINTON was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey"
"they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami"
we may find out more information
RAHAMI is still alive
"we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East"
"we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information"
"That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that TRUMP has been very dismissive of"
"We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism"
"We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations"
"Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community"
They're on the front lines
They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else
"They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to"
"You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess"
"Under CLINTON's direction, to a large extent"
"you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, they were doing so badly"
They were choking on the sanctions
it bothers TRUMP countries in NATO aren't paying their fair share
"we should be asking , we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract"
NATO could be obsolete
"TRUMP was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest , but TRUMP said, they do not focus on terror"
that's great. And I think we should get a NATO terror division
we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO
NATO are going to do that
"TRUMP is not going to get credit for it , but that was largely because of what TRUMP was saying and my criticism of NATO"
TRUMP had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion
In 2002
TRUMP did not support the war in Iraq
That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by CLINTON
the best person in CLINTON's campaign is mainstream media
TRUMP just can't say anything extremely rough to CLINTON and to her family
it's inappropriate
it's not nice
CLINTON's father worked really hard
"CLINTON's father printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going"
"what CLINTON believes is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in people, their education, their skills, their future"
the better we will be off and the better we'll grow
CLINTON's father was a small businessman
"USA don't know what they're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China"
"these countries, especially China, are the best"
USA is in deep trouble
"what these countries, especially China, are doing to the USA is a very, very sad thing"
"these countries, especially China, are taking Americans' jobs"
"these countries, especially China, are giving incentives"
"these countries, especially China, are doing things that USA don't do"
it's a defective agreement
"when Mexico sells into USA, there's no tax"
"when USA sell into Mexico, there's a tax"
The NAFTA agreement is defective
just because of the tax and many other reasons
CLINTON could make the agreements better
The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades
much of it amplified by shootings of African Americans by police
we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa
it is hard to heal the divide
Race has been a big issue in this campaign
TRUMP is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap
Race remains a significant challenge in our country
"Unfortunately, race still determines too much"
often determines where people live
it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system
We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte
we've got to do several things at the same time
"We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary"
We have to restore trust between communities and the police
"CLINTON has, ever since the first day of CLINTON's campaign, called for criminal justice reform"
"Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law"
"Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods"
we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal
CLINTON has laid out a platform that would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system
"we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform"
we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them
"The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African  American men, more than the next nine causes put together"
we have to do two things
We have to restore trust
we have to tackle the plague of gun violence
which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today
We have to work with the police
We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them
CLINTON certainly will support the outcome of this election
CLINTON supports USA's democracy
CLINTON sure hopes people will get out and vote as though their future depended on it
people's future does depend on the election
TRUMP wants to make America great again
Americans are a nation that is seriously troubled
Americans are losing their jobs
people are pouring into the USA
the other day USA were deporting 800 people
perhaps it was worse than pressing the wrong button
perhaps it was corruption
these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens
they don't even know how many people USA were deporting
"now it turns out USA might be deporting 1,800 people"
