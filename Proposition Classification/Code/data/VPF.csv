P,223816, CLINTON wants us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work,,,

P,223829, Let 's be sure we have affordable child care and debt,free college,,

V,223957," we 're losing our good jobs , so many of them",,,
V,223949, they 're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China,,,
F,223953, many other countries are doing the same thing,,,

V,224071, We can not let it happen,,,
V,224085, That 's going to be a job creator like we have n't seen since Ronald Reagan,,,

F,224144, we are 5 percent of the world 's population ; we have to trade with the other 95 percent,,,
F,224161, the kind of plan that TRUMP has put forth would be trickle,down economics all over again,,
V,224165," it would be the most extreme version , the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we 've ever had",,,
V,224177," We just have a different view about what 's best for growing the economy , how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes",,,
V,224197, we come at it from somewhat different perspectives,,,
V,224204," TRUMP was very fortunate in TRUMP's life , and that 's all to TRUMP's benefit",,,
F,224209," He started his business with $ 14 million , borrowed from his father",,,
V,233241," CLINTON and others , politicians , should have been doing this for years , not right now",,,
F,233246, we 've created a movement,,,
P,233286, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave,,,
F,233291, the companies are leaving,,,
F,233312, the companies are leaving in bigger numbers than ever,,,
F,233303, there are thousands of these companies,,,
F,233352, our politicians never tax them coming in,,,
F,233343, the special interests want those companies to leave,,,
F,233357, our politicians have special interests,,,
F,233347," in many cases, our politicians own the companies",,,
V,233423, tax policies created a perfect storm,,,
F,233419, tax policies took their eyes off of Wall Street,,,
V,233415, tax policies failed to invest in the middle class,,,
F,233411, tax policies slashed taxes on the wealthy,,,
V,233436, the Great Recession was in large part because of tax policies,,,
V,233443, TRUMP was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis,,,
V,233450," back in 2006 TRUMP was hoping it would collapse, because then he can go in and buy some houses and make some money",,,
F,233459, housing did collapse,,,
V,233497, we 're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy,,,
V,233486, now we have come back from that abyss,,,
P,233504, the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place,,,
V,233493, coming back from that abyss has not been easy,,,
F,233594, we can have enough clean energy to power every home,,,
F,233590, we can deploy a half a billion more solar panels,,,
F,233598, we can build a new modern electric grid,,,
V,233603, that 's a lot of jobs,,,
V,233607, that 's a lot of new economic activity,,,
V,233642, that was a disaster to invest in a solar company,,,
V,233648, they lost plenty of money on investing in a solar company,,,
V,233665, our energy policies are a disaster,,,
V,233660, we 're putting a lot of people out of work,,,
V,233672, our country is losing so much in terms of energy,,,
V,233676, our country is losing so much in terms of paying off our debt,,,
F,233686, CLINTON can't do what she is looking to do with $ 20 trillion in debt,,,
P,233721, we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand,,,
F,233724, they 're not doing it,,,
V,233733, all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving,,,
V,233752, CLINTON is just thinking about these solutions right now,,,
V,233747, CLINTON has been doing this for 30 years,,,
V,233775, CLINTON can't bring back jobs,,,
V,233795, CLINTON has thought about bringing back jobs for not quite that long,,,
V,233801, Bill Clinton did a pretty good job in the 1990s,,,
V,233783, CLINTON has thought about bringing back jobs quite a bit,,,
V,233808, CLINTON thinks a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again,,,
V,233826, CLINTON thinks a lot about million new jobs,,,
V,233822, CLINTON thinks a lot about a balanced budget,,,
F,233843, incomes went up for everybody,,,
F,233847," manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s , if we 're actually going to look at the facts",,,
V,233891, CLINTON has a very robust set of plans,,,
P,233886, We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business,,,
P,233882," we need to have strong growth , fair growth , sustained growth",,,
V,233902," people have looked at both of our plans , have concluded that CLINTON's would create 10 million jobs and TRUMP's would lose us 3.5 million jobs , and explode the debt which would have a recession",,,
V,233917, CLINTON is going to drive business out,,,
F,233909, CLINTON is going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history,,,
F,233913, CLINTON is going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history,,,
V,233933," CLINTON's regulations are a disaster , and CLINTON is going to increase regulations all over the place",,,
V,233949, It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs,,,
F,233940, TRUMP's tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan,,,
F,233986, new companies can not form and old companies are going out of business,,,
V,233982, You have regulations on top of regulations,,,
V,233959, CLINTON is going to regulate these businesses out of existence,,,
V,233993, CLINTON wants to increase the regulations and make them even worse,,,
B,234021, end of story,,,
V,234007, TRUMP 's going to cut taxes big league,,,
V,234014, CLINTON 's going to raise taxes big league,,,
F,234062," CLINTON has taken the home page of CLINTON's website , HillaryClinton.com , and CLINTON has turned it into a fact",checker,,
V,234050, CLINTON kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims,,,
P,234097, What CLINTON has proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy,,,
V,234101, they have made all the gains in the economy,,,
P,234114, it 's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country,,,
V,234186, TRUMP doesn't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much,,,
V,234203, CLINTON is telling the enemy everything she wants to do,,,
V,234275, TRUMP is really calling for major jobs,,,
V,234280, the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs,,,
V,234287, the wealthy are going to expand their companies,,,
V,234292, the wealthy are going to do a tremendous job,,,
F,234307," if you really look , it 's not a tax",,,
V,234312, tax is really not a great thing for the wealthy,,,
F,234340, they can't bring the money back from the overseas,,,
F,234345, politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back,,,
V,234352, the taxes are so onerous,,,
V,234359, there is the bureaucratic red tape,,,
F,234367, is so bad,,,
F,234373, what they 're doing is they 're leaving our country,,,
F,234380, they're leaving,,,
V,234387, taxes are too high,,,
V,234394, some of them have lots of money outside of our country,,,
F,234401, they're leaving instead of bringing the money back and putting the money to work,,,
F,234406, they can't work out a deal,,,
F,234418," instead of bringing money back , they're leaving our country to get their money",,,
F,234422, they can't bring their money back into our country,,,
V,234432, because of bureaucratic red tape,,,
F,234442, they ca n't get together,,,
V,234449, we have a president that ca n't sit them around a table and get them to approve something,,,
V,234456, Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done,,,
V,234461, Republicans and Democrats agree that it is $ 2.5 trillion that we can't bring to our country,,,
V,234492, we have no leadership,,,
V,234498, that starts with Secretary Clinton,,,
V,234564, I happen to support that,,,
V,234559," CLINTON doesn't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals TRUMP is referring to that would cause the repatriation , bringing back of money that 's stranded overseas",,,
V,234583," when CLINTON looks at what TRUMP has proposed , you have what is called now the Trump loophole",,,
V,234588, TRUMP's tax proposal would so advantage TRUMP and the business TRUMP does,,,
V,234649, Trickle,down did not work,,
V,234654," It got us into the mess we were in , in 2008 and 2009",,,
V,234661, Slashing taxes on the wealthy has n't worked,,,
V,234665," a lot of really smart , wealthy people know that",,,
V,234673," they are saying , hey , we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class",,,
V,234680, top,down does not work in America,,
B,234685," building the middle class , investing in the middle class , making college debt","free so more young people can get their education , helping people refinance their , their debt from college at a lower rate",,
V,234689, Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy,,,
V,234696, Broad,"based , inclusive growth is what we need in America , not more advantages for people at the very top",,
V,234706, Typical politician,,,
V,234711," All talk , no action",,,
V,234718," Sounds good , does n't work",,,
V,234728, Never going to happen,,,
F,234740, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression,,,
V,234745, believe TRUMP : We 're in a bubble right now,,,
V,234752," the only thing that looks good is the stock market , but if you raise interest rates even a little bit , that 's going to come crashing down",,,
V,234759," We are in a big , fat , ugly bubble",,,
P,234769, we better be awfully careful,,,
F,234776, we have a Fed that 's doing political things,,,
B,234781, This Janet Yellen of the Fed,,,
F,234788, The Fed is doing political,,,
F,234795, by keeping the interest rates at this level,,,
V,234802," believe TRUMP : The day Obama goes off , and OBAMA leaves , and goes out to the golf course for the rest of OBAMA's life to play golf , when they raise interest rates , you 're going to see some very bad things happen",,,
V,234806, the Fed is not doing their job,,,
V,234833, Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest,,,
F,234828," the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to , who he owes it to and any business conflicts",,,
F,234863," you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections , where TRUMP filed a 104","page essentially financial statement of sorts , the forms that they have",,
F,234868," It shows income , in fact , the income , I just looked today , the income is filed at $ 694 million for this past year , $ 694 million",,,
V,234885, we have a country that 's doing so badly,,,
V,234890, that 's being ripped off by every single country in the world,,,
V,234897, it 's the kind of thinking that our country needs,,,
F,234907," we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with , of almost $ 800 billion a year",,,
P,234989," in a way , TRUMP should be complaining",,,
F,234968, TRUMP has been under audit almost for 15 years,,,
F,234973, TRUMP knows a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited,,,
F,234984, TRUMP gets audited almost every year,,,
F,234996, TRUMP 's not even complaining,,,
V,235003, TRUMP does n't mind it,,,
F,235010, It 's almost become a way of life,,,
V,235029, We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of,,,
F,235017, TRUMP gets audited by the IRS,,,
F,235025, But other people don't,,,
V,235055," that 's against , my lawyers",,,
F,235064, TRUMP_LAWYERS : Do n't do it,,,
P,235084," When the audit 's complete , TRUMP 'll do it",,,
V,235077," Almost every lawyer says , you do n't release your returns until the audit 's complete",,,
V,235103, it 's negotiable,,,
F,235095, TRUMP would go against TRUMP_LAWYERS if CLINTON releases CLINTON's e,mails,,
P,235116, Let CLINTON release the e,mails,,
V,235121," CLINTON should not have deleted 33,000",,,
V,235468, TRUMP won't release his tax returns because of X,,,
V,235474, there may be a couple of reasons why TRUMP won't release his tax returns,,,
V,235492," maybe TRUMP doesn't want the American people and all people watching tonight , to know that he 's paid nothing in federal taxes",,,
V,235496, the only years that anybody 's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license,,,
F,235503, they showed he did n't pay any federal income tax,,,
V,235523, probably TRUMP is not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are,,,
V,235528," it must be something really important , even terrible , that he 's trying to hide",,,
F,235535, the financial disclosure statements don't give the tax rate,,,
V,235552, CLINTON has no reason to believe that TRUMP is ever going to release his tax returns,,,
V,235556, there's something TRUMP is hiding,,,
P,235587, TRUMP should provide the answers to that questions,,,
V,235583, TRUMP owes the audience the answers to that questions,,,
B,235575," were TRUMP ever to get near the White House, those conflicts would be X",,,
F,235579, TRUMP owes money to X,,,
V,235644, it was more than a mistake to use private e,mail,,
V,235652, that was done purposely,,,
V,235659, that was not a mistake,,,
V,235677, it 's disgraceful,,,
V,235668," CLINTON has her staff taking the Fifth Amendment, so they 're not prosecuted",,,
V,235673, CLINTON has the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth Amendment,,,
V,235479, maybe TRUMP is not as rich as he says he is,,,
F,235706, we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $ 650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks,,,
P,235732, CLINTON should go down and take a look at financial disclosure,,,
V,235720, CLINTON learns a lot from financial disclosure,,,
V,235750, $ 650 is really not a lot of money,,,
V,235755, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say that $ 650 is not a lot of money,,,
V,235739, TRUMP is extremely underleveraged,,,
F,235769, in the same report they said that the buildings are worth $ 3.9 billion,,,
V,235827, TRUMP is very underleveraged,,,
V,221502, TRUMP has a great company,,,
V,235840, TRUMP has a tremendous income,,,
V,235847, the reason TRUMP says that is not in a braggadocios way,,,
B,235852, TRUMP says that because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money,,,
V,235872, our airports are like from a third world country,,,
V,235876," you land at LaGuardia , you land at Kennedy , you land at LAX , you land at Newark , and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible , you come in from China , you see these incredible airports",,,
V,235883, we've become a third world country,,,
F,235859, we have $ 20 trillion in debt,,,
V,235863, our country 's a mess,,,
V,235914, the worst of all things has happened,,,
V,235932, we haven't even started,,,
F,235942, we 've spent $ 6 trillion in the Middle East,,,
V,235946, according to a report that I just saw,,,
P,235972, we could have rebuilt our country twice if we haven't spent $ 6 trillion in the Middle East,,,
V,235981, it's politicians like CLINTON that have caused this problem,,,
V,235977, it 's really a shame that we could have rebuilt our country twice if we haven't spent $ 6 trillion in the Middle East,,,
V,235991, our country has tremendous problems,,,
F,235998, we're a debtor nation,,,
P,236012," we have a country that needs new roads , new tunnels , new bridges , new airports , new schools , new hospitals",,,
V,236019, we don't have the money,,,
V,236026, the money has been squandered on so many of CLINTON's ideas,,,
F,236037, TRUMP hasn't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years,,,
V,236044," if TRUMP has paid federal income tax, this money would be squandered too",,,
V,236056, TRUMP built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys,,,
V,236060, CLINTON has met a lot of the people who were stiffed by TRUMP and TRUMP's businesses,,,
V,236070," CLINTON has met dishwashers , painters , architects , glass installers , marble installers , drapery installers , like her dad was , who TRUMP refused to pay when they finished the work that TRUMP asked them to do",,,
V,236082, You questioned his legitimacy,,,
F,236078," for five years , TRUMP perpetuated a false claim that the nation 's first black president was not a natural",born citizen,,
F,236140, TRUMP got OBAMA to give the birth certificate,,,
V,236136," When TRUMP got involved , TRUMP did n't fail",,,
V,236146, TRUMP 's satisfied with it,,,
P,236176, TRUMP wants to get on to things that are very important to TRUMP and that are very important to the country,,,
P,236164, TRUMP want to get on to defeating ISIS,,,
P,236168, TRUMP wants to get on to creating jobs,,,
P,236172, TRUMP wants to get on to having a strong border,,,
V,236116," you can go look it up , and you can check it out",,,
F,236120," if you look at CNN this past week , Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened",,,
F,236124," Blumenthal sent McClatchy , highly respected reporter at McClatchy , to Kenya to find out about it",,,
P,236196, HOLT will let TRUMP respond,,,
V,215381, it 's important,,,
V,236207, HOLT just wants to get the answer here,,,
F,236214, The birth certificate was produced in 2011,,,
F,236285, it 's true,,,
F,236293, Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter,,,
B,236300," you just have to take a look at CNN , the last week , the interview with CLINTON's former campaign manager",,,
F,236330, TRUMP says nothing,,,
F,236339, TRUMP was able to get OBAMA to produce it,,,
V,236346, OBAMA should have produced it a long time before,,,
V,236355," When HOLT talks about healing , TRUMP thinks that TRUMP has developed very , very good relationships over the last little while with the African",American community,,
V,236362, you can see that,,,
V,236369, TRUMP feels that they really wanted TRUMP to come to that conclusion,,,
V,236376," TRUMP did a great job and a great service not only for the country , but even for the president , in getting OBAMA to produce OBAMA's birth certificate",,,
V,236396, TRUMP tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed,,,
V,236391," clearly , as TRUMP just admitted , TRUMP knew TRUMP was going to stand on this debate stage , and HOLT was going to be asking us questions",,,
V,236404, it ca n't be dismissed that easily,,,
V,236411, TRUMP has really started TRUMP's political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen,,,
F,236426, TRUMP persisted year after year,,,
V,236433," some of TRUMP's supporters , people that TRUMP was trying to bring into TRUMP's fold , apparently believed it or wanted to believe it",,,
F,236422, TRUMP persisted,,,
F,236418, There was absolutely no evidence for it,,,
V,236456, TRUMP has a long record of engaging in racist behavior,,,
V,236445," remember , TRUMP started TRUMP's career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because TRUMP would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African","Americans , and TRUMP made sure that the people who worked for TRUMP understood that was the policy",,
F,236452, TRUMP actually was sued twice by the Justice Department,,,
V,236463, the birther lie was a very hurtful one,,,
V,236467, OBAMA is a man of great dignity,,,
V,236471, CLINTON could tell how much it bothered OBAMA and annoyed OBAMA that this was being touted and used against OBAMA,,,
F,236521, It does n't work that way,,,
F,236505, TRUMP got to watch in preparing for this some of CLINTON's debates against OBAMA,,,
V,236510, CLINTON treated OBAMA with terrible disrespect,,,
V,236516, TRUMP watched the way CLINTON talks now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful CLINTON is,,,
V,236528, CLINTON was after OBAMA,,,
V,236535," CLINTON was trying to , CLINTON even sent out or CLINTON's campaign sent out pictures of OBAMA in a certain garb , very famous pictures",,,

p,254671, we should be proud of the vibrancy of the black church,,,
v,254665, it's really unfortunate that TRUMP paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country,,,
f,254714, stop,and,frisk was found to be unconstitutional,
v,254719, in part because stop,and,frisk was ineffective,
f,254726, stop,and,frisk did not do what it needed to do,
f,254738," in fact, violent crime is one",half of what it was in 1991,,
f,254742, property crime is down 40 percent,,,
v,254749, we just don't want to see property crime creep back up,,,
v,254753, we've had 25 years of very good cooperation,,,
v,254768, there were some unintended consequences,,,
v,254773, too many young African,American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses,,
v,254761, there were some problems,,,
f,254782, it's just a fact that if someone is young African,"American man and he does the same thing as a young white man, he is more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated",,
p,254789, we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system,,,
v,254796, we cannot just say that law and order is sufficient,,,
p,254803, we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system,,,
p,254807," we have to deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little",,,
p,254820, we need to have more second chance programs,,,
p,254832, CLINTON wants to see private prisons ended in the state system,,,
v,254827, CLINTON is glad that USA are ending private prisons in the federal system,,,
v,254839, one shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans,,,
v,254846, here are some positive ways we can work on this,,,
v,254853, CLINTON believes strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist,,,
v,254857, right now there are too many military,style weapons on the streets,,
f,254867, too many military,style weapons on the streets is something TRUMP has supported along with the gun lobby,,
v,254878, we need comprehensive background checks,,,
f,254874, in a lot of places the police are outgunned,,,
v,254885, we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm,,,
v,254893, we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in the USA,,,
v,254898," if someone is too dangerous to fly, someone is too dangerous to buy a gun",,,
f,254905, there are things we can do,,,
p,254918, we ought to do these things in a bipartisan way,,,
p,254952," we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way",,,
v,254940," implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police",,,
v,254948, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other,,,
v,254978, mental health is one of the biggest concerns,,,
f,254982, now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street,,,
p,254960," in CLINTON's first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers",,,
f,254958, implicit bias in policing can have literally fatal consequences,,,
f,254986," the police want support, they want more training, they want more assistance",,,
f,254964," CLINTON met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago",,,
f,254974, the police got a lot of concerns,,,
f,254990, the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that,,,
v,255048, TRUMP is very proud of the endorsement of the NRA,,,
v,255036," NRA are very, very good people",,,
v,255040, NRA is protecting the Second Amendment,,,
v,255111," It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good",,,
v,255107, five hundred murders is a lot of murders,,,
v,255130, stop,and, frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City,
f,255103," in New York City, stop",and,"frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop",and
p,255091, TRUMP is talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them,,,
v,255202, CLINTON is wrong,,,
f,255199," under the current mayor, crime has not continued to drop, including murders",,,
v,255242," CLINTON gives credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs",,,
v,255246, it has worked,,,
v,255266, it is important that we learn about what has been effective,,,
v,255262, one murder is too many,,,
p,255282," we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem",,,
v,255270, we should not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want,,,
v,255274, no one disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe,,,
p,255278, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods,,,
v,255334, the African,American community has been let down by our politicians,,
v,255338," politicians talk good around election time, like right now",,,
f,255342," after the election, poiticians said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years",,,
v,255350, African,American within the inner cities has been so badly treated,,
f,255357, African,American community has been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians,,
f,255361, that's what it is,,,
b,255388, you look at the inner cities,,,
f,255393," TRUMP just left Detroit, TRUMP just left Philadelphia, and TRUMP has been all over the place",,,
v,255411, TRUMP has met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities,,,
f,255415," they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done",,,
b,255505, behind it is xxx,,,
f,255497, our institutions are under cyber attack,,,
f,255501, our secrets are being stole,,,
v,255525," cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president",,,
f,255529, clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries,,,
f,255540, there are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money,,,
f,255547," increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states",,,
f,255551, the most recent and troubling of cyber attacks coming from states has been Russia,,,
f,255555, there's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country,,,
v,255567," PUTIN is playing a really tough, long game here",,,
f,255579," one of the things PUTIN has done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee",,,
v,255618, CLINTON was shocked when TRUMP publicly invited PUTIN to hack into Americans,,,
v,255614," the Russians have been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do",,,
p,255606, we will defend the citizens of this country,,,
p,255590," we need to make it very clear , whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else , the United States has much greater capacity",,,
p,255594," we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private",sector information or our public,sector information,
p,255598, we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have,,,
v,255602, we don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare,,,
p,255610, the Russians need to understand that,,,
v,255670," CLINTON was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey",,,
f,255675," they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami",,,
f,255686, we may find out more information,,,
f,255690, RAHAMI is still alive,,,
p,255701," we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East",,,
p,255660," we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information",,,
p,255708," That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that TRUMP has been very dismissive of",,,
f,255715," We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism",,,
f,255722," We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations",,,
v,255729," Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community",,,
f,255734, They're on the front lines,,,
f,255740, They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else,,,
v,255748," They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to",,,
v,255770," You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess",,,
f,255777," Under CLINTON's direction, to a large extent",,,
v,255784," you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, they were doing so badly",,,
v,255788, They were choking on the sanctions,,,
f,255832, it bothers TRUMP countries in NATO aren't paying their fair share,,,
p,255836," we should be asking , we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract",,,
v,255846, NATO could be obsolete,,,
v,255851," TRUMP was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest , but TRUMP said, they do not focus on terror",,,
p,255871, that's great. And I think we should get a NATO terror division,,,
f,255876, we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO,,,
v,255887, NATO are going to do that,,,
v,255891," TRUMP is not going to get credit for it , but that was largely because of what TRUMP was saying and my criticism of NATO",,,
f,255943, TRUMP had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion,,,
f,255955, In 2002,,,
f,255948, TRUMP did not support the war in Iraq,,,
v,255962, That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by CLINTON,,,
v,255969, the best person in CLINTON's campaign is mainstream media,,,
v,255999, TRUMP just can't say anything extremely rough to CLINTON and to her family,,,
v,256009, it's inappropriate,,,
v,256010, it's not nice,,,
v,256093, CLINTON's father worked really hard,,,
f,256102," CLINTON's father printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going",,,
v,256110," what CLINTON believes is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in people, their education, their skills, their future",,,
v,256114, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow,,,
f,256088, CLINTON's father was a small,businessman,,
v,256174," USA don't know what they're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China",,,
v,256193," these countries, especially China, are the best",,,
v,256165, USA is in deep trouble,,,
v,256181," what these countries, especially China, are doing to the USA is a very, very sad thing",,,
f,256208," these countries, especially China, are taking Americans' jobs",,,
f,256215," these countries, especially China, are giving incentives",,,
f,256219," these countries, especially China, are doing things that USA don't do",,,
v,256254, it's a defective agreement,,,
f,256250," when Mexico sells into USA, there's no tax",,,
f,256242," when USA sell into Mexico, there's a tax",,,
v,256291, The NAFTA agreement is defective,,,
f,256295, just because of the tax and many other reasons,,,
v,256286, CLINTON could make the agreements better,,,
f,257046, The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades,,,
f,257050, much of it amplified by shootings of African,Americans by police,,
f,257057, we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa,,,
v,257071, it is hard to heal the divide,,,
v,257064, Race has been a big issue in this campaign,,,
v,257068, TRUMP is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap,,,
v,257082, Race remains a significant challenge in our country,,,
v,257090," Unfortunately, race still determines too much",,,
f,257097, often determines where people live,,,
f,257108, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system,,,
f,257112, We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte,,,
p,257122, we've got to do several things at the same time,,,
p,257134," We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary",,,
p,257129, We have to restore trust between communities and the police,,,
p,257150," CLINTON has, ever since the first day of CLINTON's campaign, called for criminal justice reform",,,
p,257141," Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law",,,
f,257146," Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods",,,
p,257166, we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal,,,
v,257157, CLINTON has laid out a platform that would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system,,,
v,257162," we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform",,,
p,257173, we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them,,,
f,257177, The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African," American men, more than the next nine causes put together",,
p,257184, we have to do two things,,,
p,257191, We have to restore trust,,,
p,257207, we have to tackle the plague of gun violence,,,
v,257211, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today,,,
p,257199, We have to work with the police,,,
p,257203, We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them,,,
p,244419, CLINTON certainly will support the outcome of this election,,,
v,244410, CLINTON supports USA's democracy,,,
p,244442, CLINTON sure hopes people will get out and vote as though their future depended on it,,,
v,244451, people's future does depend on the election,,,
p,244473, TRUMP wants to make America great again,,,
v,244478, Americans are a nation that is seriously troubled,,,
f,244485, Americans are losing their jobs,,,
f,244492, people are pouring into the USA,,,
f,244499, the other day USA were deporting 800 people,,,
v,244519, perhaps it was worse than pressing the wrong button,,,
f,244524, perhaps it was corruption,,,
f,244531, these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens,,,
f,244554, they don't even know how many people USA were deporting,,,
f,244549," now it turns out USA might be deporting 1,800 people",,,
