45,2,"We just have a different view about what 's best for growing the economy , how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes"

66,0,housing did collapse
67,2,we 're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy
68,2,now we have come back from that abyss

73,0,we can build a new modern electric grid
74,2,that 's a lot of jobs

77,2,they lost plenty of money on investing in a solar company
78,2,our energy policies are a disaster
79,2,we 're putting a lot of people out of work
80,2,our country is losing so much in terms of energy
81,2,our country is losing so much in terms of paying off our debt
82,0,CLINTON can't do what she is looking to do with $ 20 trillion in debt
83,1,we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand
84,0,they 're not doing it
85,2,all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving
86,2,CLINTON is just thinking about these solutions right now
87,2,CLINTON has been doing this for 30 years
88,2,CLINTON can't bring back jobs

99,1,"we need to have strong growth , fair growth , sustained growth"
100,2,"people have looked at both of our plans , have concluded that CLINTON's would create 10 million jobs and TRUMP's would lose us 3.5 million jobs , and explode the debt which would have a recession"

103,0,CLINTON is going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history
104,2,"CLINTON's regulations are a disaster , and CLINTON is going to increase regulations all over the place"
105,2,It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs
106,0,TRUMP's tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan
107,0,new companies can not form and old companies are going out of business
108,2,You have regulations on top of regulations

113,0,"CLINTON has taken the home page of CLINTON's website , HillaryClinton.com , and CLINTON has turned it into a fact checker"
114,2,CLINTON kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims
115,1,What CLINTON has proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy
116,2,they have made all the gains in the economy
117,1,it 's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country
118,2,TRUMP doesn't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much
119,2,CLINTON is telling the enemy everything she wants to do
120,2,TRUMP is really calling for major jobs
121,2,the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs

124,0,"if you really look , it 's not a tax"
125,2,tax is really not a great thing for the wealthy
126,0,they can't bring the money back from the overseas
127,0,politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back
128,2,the taxes are so onerous
129,2,there is the bureaucratic red tape
130,0,is so bad
131,0,what they 're doing is they 're leaving our country
132,0,they're leaving
133,2,taxes are too high
134,2,some of them have lots of money outside of our country
135,0,they're leaving instead of bringing the money back and putting the money to work
136,0,they can't work out a deal
137,0,"instead of bringing money back , they're leaving our country to get their money"
138,0,they can't bring their money back into our country
139,2,because of bureaucratic red tape
140,0,they ca n't get together
141,2,we have a president that ca n't sit them around a table and get them to approve something
142,2,Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done
143,2,Republicans and Democrats agree that it is $ 2.5 trillion that we can't bring to our country
144,2,we have no leadership
145,2,that starts with Secretary Clinton
146,2,I happen to support that
147,2,"CLINTON doesn't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals TRUMP is referring to that would cause the repatriation , bringing back of money that 's stranded overseas"
148,2,"when CLINTON looks at what TRUMP has proposed , you have what is called now the Trump loophole"
149,2,TRUMP's tax proposal would so advantage TRUMP and the business TRUMP does
150,2,Trickle down did not work
151,2,"It got us into the mess we were in , in 2008 and 2009"
152,2,Slashing taxes on the wealthy has n't worked
153,2,"a lot of really smart , wealthy people know that"
154,2,"they are saying , hey , we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class"
155,2,top down does not work in America
156,2,Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy
157,2,"Broad based , inclusive growth is what we need in America , not more advantages for people at the very top"
158,2,Typical politician
159,2,"All talk , no action"
160,2,"Sounds good , does n't work"
161,2,Never going to happen
162,0,we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression
163,2,believe TRUMP : We 're in a bubble right now
164,2,"the only thing that looks good is the stock market , but if you raise interest rates even a little bit , that 's going to come crashing down"
165,2,"We are in a big , fat , ugly bubble"
166,1,we better be awfully careful
167,0,we have a Fed that 's doing political things
168,0,The Fed is doing political
169,0,by keeping the interest rates at this level
170,2,"believe TRUMP : The day Obama goes off , and OBAMA leaves , and goes out to the golf course for the rest of OBAMA's life to play golf , when they raise interest rates , you 're going to see some very bad things happen"
171,2,the Fed is not doing their job
172,2,Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest
173,0,"the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to , who he owes it to and any business conflicts"
174,0,"you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections , where TRUMP filed a 104 page essentially financial statement of sorts , the forms that they have"
175,0,"It shows income , in fact , the income , I just looked today , the income is filed at $ 694 million for this past year , $ 694 million"
176,2,we have a country that 's doing so badly
177,2,that 's being ripped off by every single country in the world
178,2,it 's the kind of thinking that our country needs
179,0,"we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with , of almost $ 800 billion a year"
180,1,"in a way , TRUMP should be complaining"
181,0,TRUMP has been under audit almost for 15 years
182,0,TRUMP knows a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited
183,0,TRUMP gets audited almost every year
184,0,TRUMP 's not even complaining
185,2,TRUMP does n't mind it
186,0,It 's almost become a way of life
187,2,We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of
188,0,TRUMP gets audited by the IRS
189,0,But other people don't
190,2,"that 's against , my lawyers"
191,0,TRUMP_LAWYERS : Do n't do it
192,1,"When the audit 's complete , TRUMP 'll do it"
193,2,"Almost every lawyer says , you do n't release your returns until the audit 's complete"
194,2,it 's negotiable
195,0,TRUMP would go against TRUMP_LAWYERS if CLINTON releases CLINTON's e mails
196,1,Let CLINTON release the e mails
197,2,"CLINTON should not have deleted 33,000"
198,2,TRUMP won't release his tax returns because of X
199,2,there may be a couple of reasons why TRUMP won't release his tax returns
200,2,"maybe TRUMP doesn't want the American people and all people watching tonight , to know that he 's paid nothing in federal taxes"
201,2,the only years that anybody 's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license
202,0,they showed he did n't pay any federal income tax
203,2,probably TRUMP is not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are
204,2,"it must be something really important , even terrible , that he 's trying to hide"
205,0,the financial disclosure statements don't give the tax rate
206,2,CLINTON has no reason to believe that TRUMP is ever going to release his tax returns
207,2,there's something TRUMP is hiding
208,1,TRUMP should provide the answers to that questions
209,2,TRUMP owes the audience the answers to that questions
210,0,TRUMP owes money to X
211,2,it was more than a mistake to use private e mail
212,2,that was done purposely
213,2,that was not a mistake
214,2,it 's disgraceful
215,2,"CLINTON has her staff taking the Fifth Amendment, so they 're not prosecuted"
216,2,CLINTON has the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth Amendment
217,2,maybe TRUMP is not as rich as he says he is
218,0,we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $ 650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks
219,1,CLINTON should go down and take a look at financial disclosure
220,2,CLINTON learns a lot from financial disclosure
221,2,$ 650 is really not a lot of money
222,2,a lot of friends of mine that know my business say that $ 650 is not a lot of money
223,2,TRUMP is extremely underleveraged
224,0,in the same report they said that the buildings are worth $ 3.9 billion
225,2,TRUMP is very underleveraged
226,2,TRUMP has a great company
227,2,TRUMP has a tremendous income
228,2,the reason TRUMP says that is not in a braggadocios way
229,2,our airports are like from a third world country
230,2,"you land at LaGuardia , you land at Kennedy , you land at LAX , you land at Newark , and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible , you come in from China , you see these incredible airports"
231,2,we've become a third world country
232,0,we have $ 20 trillion in debt
233,2,our country 's a mess
234,2,the worst of all things has happened
235,2,we haven't even started
236,0,we 've spent $ 6 trillion in the Middle East
237,2,according to a report that I just saw
238,1,we could have rebuilt our country twice if we haven't spent $ 6 trillion in the Middle East
239,2,it's politicians like CLINTON that have caused this problem
240,2,it 's really a shame that we could have rebuilt our country twice if we haven't spent $ 6 trillion in the Middle East
241,2,our country has tremendous problems
242,0,we're a debtor nation
243,1,"we have a country that needs new roads , new tunnels , new bridges , new airports , new schools , new hospitals"
244,2,we don't have the money
245,2,the money has been squandered on so many of CLINTON's ideas
246,0,TRUMP hasn't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years
247,2,"if TRUMP has paid federal income tax, this money would be squandered too"
248,2,TRUMP built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys
249,2,CLINTON has met a lot of the people who were stiffed by TRUMP and TRUMP's businesses
250,2,"CLINTON has met dishwashers , painters , architects , glass installers , marble installers , drapery installers , like her dad was , who TRUMP refused to pay when they finished the work that TRUMP asked them to do"
251,2,You questioned his legitimacy
252,0,"for five years , TRUMP perpetuated a false claim that the nation 's first black president was not a natural born citizen"
253,0,TRUMP got OBAMA to give the birth certificate
254,2,"When TRUMP got involved , TRUMP did n't fail"
255,2,TRUMP 's satisfied with it

257,1,TRUMP want to get on to defeating ISIS
258,1,TRUMP wants to get on to creating jobs
259,1,TRUMP wants to get on to having a strong border
260,2,"you can go look it up , and you can check it out"
261,0,"if you look at CNN this past week , Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened"
262,0,"Blumenthal sent McClatchy , highly respected reporter at McClatchy , to Kenya to find out about it"
263,1,HOLT will let TRUMP respond
264,2,it 's important
265,2,HOLT just wants to get the answer here
266,0,The birth certificate was produced in 2011
267,0,it 's true
268,0,Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter
269,0,TRUMP says nothing
270,0,TRUMP was able to get OBAMA to produce it
271,2,OBAMA should have produced it a long time before
272,2,"When HOLT talks about healing , TRUMP thinks that TRUMP has developed very , very good relationships over the last little while with the African American community"
273,2,you can see that
274,2,TRUMP feels that they really wanted TRUMP to come to that conclusion
275,2,"TRUMP did a great job and a great service not only for the country , but even for the president , in getting OBAMA to produce OBAMA's birth certificate"
276,2,TRUMP tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed
277,2,"clearly , as TRUMP just admitted , TRUMP knew TRUMP was going to stand on this debate stage , and HOLT was going to be asking us questions"
278,2,it ca n't be dismissed that easily
279,2,TRUMP has really started TRUMP's political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen
280,0,TRUMP persisted year after year
281,2,"some of TRUMP's supporters , people that TRUMP was trying to bring into TRUMP's fold , apparently believed it or wanted to believe it"
282,0,TRUMP persisted
283,0,There was absolutely no evidence for it
284,2,TRUMP has a long record of engaging in racist behavior
285,2,"remember , TRUMP started TRUMP's career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because TRUMP would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African Americans , and TRUMP made sure that the people who worked for TRUMP understood that was the policy"
286,0,TRUMP actually was sued twice by the Justice Department
287,2,the birther lie was a very hurtful one
288,2,OBAMA is a man of great dignity
289,2,CLINTON could tell how much it bothered OBAMA and annoyed OBAMA that this was being touted and used against OBAMA
290,0,It does n't work that way
291,0,TRUMP got to watch in preparing for this some of CLINTON's debates against OBAMA

294,2,CLINTON was after OBAMA
295,2,"CLINTON was trying to , CLINTON even sent out or CLINTON's campaign sent out pictures of OBAMA in a certain garb , very famous pictures"
296,0,CLINTON cannot deny that
297,0,"just last week , CLINTON's campaign manager said it was true"
298,2,"TRUMP also notices the very nasty commercials that CLINTON does on TRUMP in so many different ways , which TRUMP does n't do on CLINTON"
299,2,Maybe TRUMP 's trying to save the money
300,0,that is amazing
301,2,TRUMP notices CLINTON brings that up a lot
302,0,"TRUMP settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt , but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms , and it 's just one of those things"
303,2,comments like that really worry people who understand the threats that we face
304,2,TRUMP is unfit to be the commander  in chief
305,0,more endorsements are coming next week

309,0,TRUMP was just endorsed by ICE
310,0,"TRUMP was just recently endorsed by 16,500 Border Patrol agents"
311,2,"when CLINTON talks about this, TRUMP will take the admirals and the generals any day over the political hacks that TRUMP sees that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge"
312,2,we're in a mess
313,2,"as far as the cyber attacks, TRUMP agrees to parts of what CLINTON said"
314,1,we should be better than anybody else
315,2,perhaps we 're not better than anybody else
316,2,TRUMP doesn't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC
317,2,TRUMP doesn't claim that Rusia is for sure responsible for cyber attacks
318,2,it could also be China
319,2,it could also be lots of other people
320,2,it also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds
321,0,"whether that was Russia , whether that was China , whether it was another country , we do n't know"
322,2,"he truth is , under President Obama we 've lost control of things that we used to have control over"
323,2,CLINTON and TRUMP would agree very much when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet
324,2,ISIS are beating USA at their own game
325,1,we have to get very tough on cyber and cyber warfare
326,2,it is a huge problem
327,2,we have so many things that we have to do better
328,2,we are not doing the job we should be doing with the security aspect of cyber
329,1,CLINTON's plan to defeat ISIS does involve going after ISIS online

333,1,USA is hoping that within the year USA will be able to push ISIS out of Iraq

335,1,we have to make this the top priority
336,2,USA have to be cognizant of the fact that ISIS has had foreign money
337,2,USA have to be cognizant of the fact that ISIS has had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them
338,2,USA have to be cognizant of the fact that ISIS has had foreign weapons

341,0,CLINTON was involved in taking out bin Laden

353,0,ISIS was formed
354,2,CLINTON has been taking out ISIS a long time
355,2,CLINTON has been trying to take ISIS out for a long time
356,2,"ISIS would n't have even been formed if OBAMA and CLINTON left some troops behind , like 10,000 or maybe something more than that"
357,2,"had USA taken the oil, ISIS would not have been able to form either"
358,0,the oil was their primary source of income
359,0,TRUMP supported the invasion of Iraq
360,2,it is absolutely proved over and over again that TRUMP supported the invasion of Iraq
361,0,TRUMP actually advocated for the actions OBAMA and CLINTON took in Libya
362,0,TRUMP urged that Gadhafi be taken out
363,2,the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then Iraqi government that would have protected the US troops
364,2,"the larger point , and he says this constantly , is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq , not Barack Obama"
